# Twitter Streaming Pipeline

Simple data pipeline using the Twitter Streaming API.

Built with the goal of learning the Spark Structured Streaming API and Kafka.

Using:
- Docker and docker-compose for image creation and containers orchestration.
- Tweepy for connecting, consuming the Twitter API.
- Apache Kafka for event streaming from twitter api to spark streams.
- Apache Spark to read from Kafka Topics.


For now, the TwitterStreamingClient only sends a simple sample data.
